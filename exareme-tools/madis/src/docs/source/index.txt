madIS is a extensible relational database system build upon the SQLite database and with extensions written in Python.

The extensibility permits quick experimentation concerning data analysis tasks, rapid development of data processing workflows and serves in general as a simple and easy environment to test database related ideas without much effort.
madIS' query language is SQL with some syntactic "extensions" aiming to simplify query composition.
