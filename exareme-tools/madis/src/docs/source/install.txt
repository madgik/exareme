Installing madIS
================

The requirements for using madIS are:

1.  **Python 2.6.x** or **2.7.x**: You can download a windows distribution of Python from
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/ .You need to download the latest
    Python in the 2.6 or 2.7 series. madIS doesn't currently work with Python 3.0.

.. note::
    Most Linux distributions come with Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 preinstalled.

2.  **APSW**:

    Windows:

    Download the windows distribution of `APSW` from http://code.google.com/p/apsw/downloads/list .

    Linux:

    Most Linux distributions contain in their repositories a sufficiently recent version of `APSW`.
    If you use Ubuntu 10.04 and later, install the `python-apsw` package::

        sudo apt-get install python-apsw

    In case `APSW` is not provided with your Linux distribution of choise, `APSW` should be build from source.
    The detailed instructions for building `APSW` can be found at:

    http://apidoc.apsw.googlecode.com/hg/build.html#recommended

    A quick command line to build and install `APSW` is::

        sudo python setup.py fetch --all --missing-checksum-ok build install

    If you are using Ubuntu and wish to build `APSW` from source, you also need the packages::

        build-essential libreadline5-dev zlib1g-dev python-dev

    MacOS:

    On *MacOS 10.6* install `APSW` and `readline` via `easy_install`::

        easy_install apsw
        easy_install readline

    On *MacOS 10.7* you have to build `APSW` from source (as showed above), for which you'll
    also need *Xcode*.

    After building `APSW`, install `readline` via `easy_install`::

        sudo easy_install readline

3.  Download the madIS archive (.zip) from:

    http://code.google.com/p/madis/downloads/list

4.  Uncompress above zip file

5.  Use madis by entering into the new "madis/" path and executing "python mterm.py"
