Thanks
======
madIS project wouldn't exist without the amazing work of several other people, and the
Open Source spirit.

Specifically we would like to thank:

- APSW's Roger Binns
- SQLite's authors

In both of above projects, the work ethic and quality of their code are of an
extremely high level. Nearly every line of their code is extensively tested.

In madIS we stressed the code of both of above projects as much as we could, and
they handled it beautifully.
